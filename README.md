# BookTracker
The project is a simple book tracking web application.
It allows users to sign up and log in to their own account.
Once logged in, users can add books they are currently reading, including the book title and the current page number.
The books are stored in a MySQL database.
Users can view their book list on a user page, where they can also add additional books.
The web application uses Flask as the web framework to serve HTTP requests.
It uses Jinja2 as the templating engine to render dynamic content.
CSS is used to style the web pages, making them visually appealing and easy to use.
The application is hosted locally on the user's machine using the Flask development server.
The project demonstrates how to use Flask, Jinja2, and MySQL together to create a simple web application.
